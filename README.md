Hello There!

This program is intended to check if a year is a leap year or not.

It will Test the coded years also!

In the testing part of the code will return a 'Failed' message if the year do not match with the coded result.

It can be changed as many times you want in the variables 'test_data' (line 17) and 'test_results' (line 20) in a way to have the same number of items (make sure the lenght of both will match) to get the answers you need.

'Ok' stands for leap year and True or NOT leap year and False.

'Failed' stands for leap year and False or NOT leap year and True.

This program is a resulting part of the Cisco Networking Academy pratice exercise.

Have fun!
